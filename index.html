 <h3>Education</h3>
 <UL>
   <li>I went to DPS DURG for my Class 10 schooling, which served as the starting point for the rest of my academic career. It was a crucial time when I not only learned crucial information, but also developed a sense of discipline and curiosity. My teachers were quite influential icourses since they placed a strong emphasis on problem-solving and critical thinking skills in addition to rote learning. Mathematics, science, and language classes pushed me and taught me the value of tenacity and diligence.</li>
   <li>Class 12 was a pivotal point in my academic life. I went to a school called DPS DURG, which not only helped me learn more but also inspired me to delve further into my passions. I was able to concentrate on topics that matched my goals because the curriculum became more specialized. My analytical and research skills were sharpened by rigorous study, practical experiments, and projects. </li>
